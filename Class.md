# Classes

## Peasant

Peasants have no special abilities.

## Lobbyist

The lobbyist earns double points for accepted proposals. He may also offer other players
some of these points in exchange for approving his rule.

## Buddha

The Buddha is mainly concerned with karma. At the beginning of his turn, the Buddha adds his VK to his points.

Instead of proposing a forceful rule, the Buddha may meditate:

1. He proposes the *null rule* and neither gains nor loses points, so voting has no effect.
2. If there were previous rules of wisdom/despair, they are removed.
3. He adds his words of wisdom above the rule list.
4. He gains two extra VK.

## Minimalist

The minimalist's job is to keep the rules short and sweet. At the beginning of
his turn he counts the number of words in README.md and compares that to the beginning
of his last turn. For every word less, he gains 1 point.

## Police

The police gains 10 points for every misspelling or broken rule they point out, except their own. 

## Corrupt Cop

The Corrupt Cop gains 15 points for every misspelling they are able to get approved and written into the rules (rules include this class file). 

The Police have one chance to catch the Corrupt Cop. The Police player can comment on the rule proposal before it is approved and identify EVERY misspelling. If the Police misses one or more misspelling, the Police loses 5 points for a botched investigation. If the Police identifies every misspelling in the proposal then it is a succesful investigation and the Corrupt Cop loses 25 points. Only one Police player may attempt this per rule proposal. 

## Dark Budddhist

The Dark Buddhist can cast harmful magic at the cost of their own VK. At the beginning of their turn, if possible, the Dark Buddhist must spend at least one of their VK to remove one VK from another player. The Dark Buddhist can choose to spend more VK to remove more from the same or other players at a rate of one to one. They can only spend VK in their possession at the start of their turn. 

Instead of proposing a forceful rule, the Dark Buddhist may meditate:

1. He proposes the *null rule* and neither gains nor loses points, so voting has no effect.
2. If there were previous rules of wisdom/despair, they are removed.
3. He adds his words of despair above the rule list.
4. He gains two extra VK.

## Zombies

Players that started the game but have stopped playing. A player is assigned the Zombie class by unanimous votes of the other players. Zombies can only exist in a game with three or more players. 

## Necromancer

The Necromance gains the voting powers of zombies. For each zombie in the game, the necromancer MAY cast an extra vote for rule proposals. 

1. This extra vote does not apply outside of rule proposals (for example, does not apply in assigning zombie class). 
2. The extra Zombie vote is treated as having zero VK
3. After using this power the Necromance will lose all karma and have zero VK

## The God of Pizza

The God of Pizza has two powers:

1. For each fresh pizza he eats he gets 20 VK. He does not have to eat the whole pizza but leftovers from one pizza cannot be used to score twice. 
2. For each pizza the God of Pizza has delivered (bought or homemade) to another player's house, he gets 40 VK and 5 points. 

The powers are limited to three pizza per day, in total. For example, the God of Pizza can get points for ordering two pizzas to other players and eating one pizza themself in one day. The God of Pizza is permitted to eat/deliver more pizzas than the three but will not receive points for them. 

Proof of pizza can be established via a photo containing the pizza and a website with the time and date. The photos can be uploaded to the nomic slack group. If the pizza contains meat, the God of Pizza immediately goes to zero VK.
