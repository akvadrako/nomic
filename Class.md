# Classes

## Peasant

Peasants have no special abilities.

## Lobbyist

The lobbyist earns double points for accepted proposals. He may also offer other players
some of these points in exchange for approving his rule.

## Buddha

The Buddha is mainly concerned with karma. At the beginning of his turn, the Buddha adds his VK to his points.

Instead of proposing a forceful rule, the Buddha may meditate:

1. He proposes the *null rule* and neither gains nor loses points, so voting has no effect.
2. If there were previous rules of wisdom, they are removed.
3. He adds his words of wisdom above the rule list.
4. He gains one extra VK.

## Minimalist

The minimalist's job is to keep the rules short and sweet. At the beginning of
his turn he counts the number of words in README.md and compares that to the beginning
of his last turn. For every word less, he gains 1 point.

## Police

The police gains 10 points for every misspelling or broken rule they point out, except their own.
