**§ 307.1 'Fruits' side game rules**

For this side game, each new rule proposal must be accompanied by a selfie with one piece of fruit. The piece of fruit must be unique in that it cannot already be posted in an earlier round.

If a player does not, or cannot, post a selfie with a unique piece of fruit with their rule proposal, that player forfeits the 'Fruits' side game and is not eligible for any points.

**§ 307.2 Legitimacy of selfies and fruits**

A selfie is legitimate if the piece of fruit is an actual physical item. A rendering of piece of fruit is not considered legitimate.

A piece of fruit is legitimate if it is listed on the Wikipedia page for fruits (https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fruits). If a piece of fruit is not on this list, they are not considered legitimate for the purpose of this side game.

**§ 307.3 Rewards**

The last player that posted a selfie with a unique piece of fruit while the 'Fruits' side game is going is awarded 50 points.

**§ 307.4 Ending the 'Fruits' side game**

The 'Fruits' side game can end in the following ways:

a. There are no more unique fruits available to post
b. There is only one Player left who has not forfeited the side game
c. This rule (307) is repealed in a later round

**§ 307.5 Repository**

Selfies will be posted on the Github page of this game in a seperate folder for later review. They must be titled with the fruit and player in question, seperated by a dash (eg. Banana - RamonRB)
