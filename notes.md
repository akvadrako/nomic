On your turn:

1. You need a github account.
2. Go to [README.md](https://github.com/akvadrako/nomic/blob/master/README.md). The [repo homepage](https://github.com/akvadrako/nomic) also works if you're a member.
3. Click the ðŸ–‰ (edit) button at the top-right of the rules.
4. Change the rule text.
5. At the bottom, click **Propose file Change**

Now everybody votes on the [Pull request](https://github.com/akvadrako/nomic/pulls).

### Rule formatting

Write like this:

```
**100.** some text blah blah
```

to get this:

**100.** some text blah blah
